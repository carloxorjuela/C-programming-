- Willingness to learn and practice
- **No prior programming experience required!**

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Install a C++ Compiler

**Windows:**
- Install [MinGW-w64](https://www.mingw-w64.org/) or [Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/)

**Mac:**
- Install Xcode Command Line Tools: `xcode-select --install`
- Or install via Homebrew: `brew install gcc`

**Linux:**
- Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt install build-essential`
- CentOS/RHEL: `sudo yum install gcc-c++`

### 2. Choose a Text Editor or IDE

**Beginner-friendly options:**
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (Free, cross-platform)
- [Code::Blocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/) (Free, simple)
- [Dev-C++](https://www.bloodshed.net/devcpp.html) (Windows, beginner-friendly)

**Professional IDEs:**
- [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) (Paid, powerful)
- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) (Windows)

### 3. Verify Your Setup

Create a simple test file and compile it:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello, C++ World!" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

Compile and run:
```bash
g++ -o hello hello.cpp
./hello
```
